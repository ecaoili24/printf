Printf is a function that writes output to the stdout, which is the standard output stream.

Also, the function writes the output according to the format string. This format string specifies how the following arguments are converted for output.

The function returns the number of characters printed for success. Note: It excludes the null byte used to end output to strings.

The function returns a negative value if an output error occurs.
.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string. It contains zero or more directives. The directives are ordinary characters and do not include %, which are copied to the output stream. It also includes, conversion specifications that results in obtaining zero or more subsequent arguments. To introduce a conversion specification, a character % and a conversion specifier are used.

The arguments must match to the correct conversion specifier.
.SH The conversion specifier
A conversion specifier is a character that specifies the type of conversion to be used. The conversion specifiers and their use are:
.SH d, i
The int argument is converted to a signed decimal notation.
