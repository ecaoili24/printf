# Printf Project
## Synopsis
The printf function in the C programming language, prints output according to format. 
The print function is used to print the "character, string, integer, percent, and a reverse of a string" onto the output screen. 
## Description
 The printf function produces output according a format that follows conversion specifiers. A conversion specifier is a character that specifies the type of conversion to be used. It is used during input and output. 

It tells the compiler what type of data is in the varaible when printing using printf. They are listed below. 

Printf is a function that writes output to the stdout, which is the standard output stream. Also, the function writes the output according to the format string. This format string specifies how the following arguments are converted for output.

##### The conversion specifiers used in this project are:
1. %c: Prints a single character.
2. %s: Prints a string of characters.
3. %d: Prints integers.
4. %i: Prints integers.
5. %r: Prints a reversed string
